Starting Point:
I created entirely new files in the Project-1 Repository that I think will be a good starting point and easy to pick individual tasks to merge together.
I would recomend creating a new branch of the files I added and doing work in that branch then pushing those changes and creating a pull request when we want to merge.
There is some basic psuedo coding of what we are trying to accomplish written in the files.
On Trello I made a mini SCRUM board, with tasks we need to complete, feel free to add other tasks and what not.
On Trello I listed four columns 'Tasks to Do', 'In Progress', 'Review', and 'Complete', Anyone can take any task, just make sure to move the task into the 'In Progress' list and add a comment so we know who is doing what.
